This package contains an Eiffel library for socket communications.
The code works with ISE Eiffel compiler and it was only tested
on Linux.

This library is released under the Eiffel Forum license. See
the file "forum.txt". 

If you do something cool with this code please give me credit.
If you you do something bad, don't blame me. ;-)


This distribution is divided into the following directories and files:
	

	README					- this file
	forum.txt				- Eiffel Forum license file
	CHANGELOG				- notes of what changed and what I'm working
							  on, include design notes
	./lib+					- socket classes
		|
		+ ise_specific		- classes specific to ISE
	./C						- C code needed for the library
	./examples
		|
		+ simple			- simplest example of communication with sockets
		|
		+ server			- simple server
		|
		+ misc				- junk
	./emu_httpd				- Eiffel micro http server ("Emu")

My intention is to port this code to other compilers, so I'm trying
to make it as portable as I can. 


With the most recent version (1/6/98) if you are compiling with ISE
compiler, you have to set up an environment variable: INCLUDE_PATH
that points to the directory that contains the "eiffel_socket.h" file.
For me this variable is set like this:

	export INCLUDE_PATH=-I/home/nrichieb/Eiffel/socket/C


Any suggestions, improvements, bug reports email: richieb@netlabs.net
